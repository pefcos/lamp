# lamp and lampi
A boolean (lamp) based esoteric programming language, and its interpreter.

Examples can be found in the examples directory.

## Lamp documentation

### Syntax
Lamp's syntax is much simples than other programming languages, as lamp has no indicators of coda blocks such as "{}" or even ":". Lamp also is indentation independent, which means that lamp code has only one requirement after all: the keywords need to be spaced and sequential.

### Variable types
Since it is a boolean based language, all values in lamp are either on (true) or off (false). With that in mind, there are no types such as integers or strings, instead, the lamp language has two types: lamps and switches. A lamp is a variable that is either on or off (just like a real life lamp). An example of lamp declaration would be: `lamp example on`. This creates a lamp called example with the value on. 

A switch is analogous to a real life switch, that has an on and off position. Each position in a switch can hold a value, but all switches have only two positions, no more, no less. A basic example of a switch declaration would be: `switch example (on off)`. This creates a switch that holds the value on in the first position (called the off position) and the value off in the second position (called the on position). To access the first value we can type `example.off` while to access the second value we can type `example.on`. Simple, right? Now for the most interesting part. Switches can hold another switch instead of an on/off value, making nested switches not only viable, but essential. For example, we could declare a switch within a switch like this: `switch example (on (off on))`. Now, when accessing the off position, the value would be not on or off, but the `(on off)` switch. To access an element within the inner switch (off element for the example), we can type the following: `example.off.off`.

### Displaying values
There are two types of displays, a block display and a word display. Word displays are inferred while block displays have to be explicited. For example, consider the following code:
```
lamp example on
display example
```
This code creates a lamp called example with the value on, and prints the word "on" on the screen. But interaction with the user becomes boring if you can only say "on" and "off". This is why the block display exists! An example of a block display would be:
```
lamp example on
display block example
```
This would print a "â–ˆ" on the screen.

Now you know about block displays, but they are kind of useless for lamps. Let's talk about displaying switches! They are displayed the same way as lamps and can also be displayed in blocks and words. Pairing block displays with switches gives you a creative way to draw on the display.

### Namespaces
The lamp programming language supports namespaces. Namespaces are added to variables by inserting the namespace of the variable and its name after a ":". An example would be `lamp ex:example on`, where "ex" is the namespace and "example" is the name of the lamp. Namespacing your variables allows you to have variables with the same name in multiple places on your code without getting lost. For example, the code below:
```
lamp a:example on
lamp b:example off
display a:example
```
will display "on".

A thing to note is that all variables have namespaces, even if implied. The default namespace for lamps is "lamp", while the default namespace for switch is "switch". The line of lamp code `lamp example on` will actually create a lamp example inside the "lamp" namespace, therefore it is the same as writing `lamp lamp:example on`. Namespacing may seem unnecessary given what you know about lamp so far, but it will come in handy in the next section.

### Circuits
Now for the hard part! You know how in other programming languages we have functions or methods to divide code? In lamp, we call those circuits, and understanding how they work is paramount for you to be a good lamp programmer. Circuits are declared with the "circuit" keyword before the circuit name and end with the `ground` keyword. The code `circuit example` will define a circuit starting in the next statement, ending only when the `ground` of the circuit is found. A basic example of circuit definition would be:
```
circuit example_circ
  lamp example (on off)
  display example
ground
```
Ok, so you can write a circuit, great, now you need to learn how to call them! To execute code inside a circuit you have to type the word "power" followed by the circuit name and the "on" word, or a reference to a lamp with value on. If you type `power example_circ on`, you can start the code inside the example circuit we made before. If you typed `power example_circ off`, the circuit example_circ would not be called.

Where can I call a circuit? Anywhere that is not inside itself, as lamp does not yet support recursion (work in progress). This gives versatility to the syntax, as circuit definitions between lines of code will be ignored by lampi until it is called (and will be ignored forever if there is no "power" statement).

Why do I have to put "on" in every circuit powering? Because, you may have noticed, lamp language has no "if" statement, like other languages do. The way to write a if statement in lamp is a clever trick involving circuits. The code:
```
power example_circ example_lamp
circuit example_circ
  lamp new on
  display new
ground
```
will only execute the circuit "example_circ" if the lamp "example_lamp" is on. Otherwise, it will not. This is the same as writing something like `if(example_lamp)` in other languages.

Now about namespaces and circuits. There is no variable scope in lamp, so it means that the code:
```
circuit example_circ
  lamp example on
  display example
ground

lamp example off
example_circ
display example
```
will display "off" two times, as both lamp assignment statements change the lamp "lamp:example". Using namespaces we can change the code to:
```
circuit example_circ
  lamp example_circ:example on
  display example_circ:example
ground

lamp example off
example_circ
display example
```
and now the displaying will show a "on" and a "off", since they both modify a lamp called example, but in different namespaces.

This concludes the presentation of all of lamp's simple features.

## Lampi usage

Lampi is the lamp interpreter for linux operating systems, which can be invoked running "lampi" with the path to the .lamp file with your lamp code. An usage example would be `./lampi example.lamp`, to interpret the "example.lamp" file.

A lampi binary is provided in this repository, but to compile your own lampi you can clone this repository and execute `make lampi` on the repository's root directory.
